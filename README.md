# TIThermometer

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**

The project included is to develop a smart thermostat on the texas instruments CI3220S. In this project we programmed a thermostat that read input from the surrounding environment / room with its sensor on the board. The information was read from the sensor and synthesized to determine if the heat should be turned on or not, resulting in output to the terminal and LED sensor.

**What did you do particularly well?**

My code was readable with correct spacing so that others could also review the code with ease. The program is also thoroughly noted so that the programmer viewing the code can understand what was trying to be accomplished.

**Where could you improve?**

As an early programmer I'm certain my methods are a bit convoluted and a mashup of things that could be streamlined.

**What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?**

I never used the actual technical documentation before this course, as I was able to find a lot of what I needed online for past projects. This program required very heavy referencing to it and I couldn't take many shortcuts to reaching a solution where I was able to get by without technical documentation and find solutions on Stack Overflow or Youtube in the past. 

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?**

I've learned a lot more and just how critical the original documentation is. It will also make mwe want to provide better documentation and diagrams for any projects I work on in the future to help others better understand what I was trying to accomplish and what could be accomplished with what I've made.

**How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

I documented my code with notes and kept its structure modular so that it could be easily understood and built on in the future. The styling was consistent as well.
